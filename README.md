## Get access to VPS's terminal

Skip this part if you already have connection to your VPS instance.

## Setup

Everything is build in, just need to setup some credentials in multiple different places. Then you will be able to use scripts to deploy WordPress to your VPS instance. Don't skip any step, each of them is important.

### 0. Set up SSH connection to VPS



### 1. Prepare VPS

#### Option: Use local script

Linux: Execute the script `./scripts/linux/setup/SetupVPS.sh`
Windows: Execute the script `./scripts/windows/setup/SetupVPS.bat`

#### Option: Manual remote terminal

Execute the script `~/deployment/scripts/setup/SetupVPS.sh`

```bash
sh ~/deployment/scripts/setup/SetupVPS.sh
```

### 2. Nginx

Open file `deployment/nginx-conf/nginx.conf`. Replace `********` by your domain name in 6 different places, make sure you don't miss any. File lines: 5, 52, 57, 58.

> The domain name is doubled two times for `www` and `non-www` versions. Keep it.

### 3. MySQL credentials

Open file `deployment/.env`. Replace `********` by your database credentials. You can use any. At first deployment it will be used to create database and user. For the next times it will be used for authentication. Make sure you don't change this file after first deployment, in other case you may have issues because incorrect credentials.

- `MYSQL_USER`
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`

> Make sure you have visible hidden files in your file explorer.

### 4. CertBot + Let's Encrypt (SSL)

Open file `deployment/.env`. Replace `********` by your data.

- `SSL_CERTIFICATE_EMAIL` - email address that will be used as owner of domain name
- `SSL_CERTIFICATE_DOMAIN` - your domain name

### 5. SSL certificate: create, use and renew

`CertBot` + `Let's Encrypt` will create SSL certificate for your domain name. It will be used by `NGINX` to serve your website via `HTTPS`. You need to follow this tutorial just once, then it will be auto-renewed.

#### 5.1 üîÑ Force renewal

Open file `deployment/.env`. Make sure `SSL_START_MODE` is set to `force-renewal`

```bash
SSL_START_MODE=force-renewal
```

#### 5.2 ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy

Deploy `deployment` folder to VPS using **[Deploy Instruction](https//github.com/IvanMurzak/WordPress-VPS/README_DEPLOY.md)**.

#### 5.3 üîé Validate

Verify that HTTPS works after 30 seconds by opening your domain name in browser. If doesn't check your domain name DNS settings.

#### 5.4 üí† Staging

Open file `deployment/.env`. Make sure `SSL_START_MODE` is set to `staging`

```bash
SSL_START_MODE=staging
```

#### 5.5 ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy (again)

Deploy `deployment` folder to VPS using **[Deploy Instruction](https//github.com/IvanMurzak/WordPress-VPS/README_DEPLOY.md)**.

## 6. Finish üèÅ

All done! You can now open your domain name in browser and see your WordPress website. You can also open `https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=yourdomainname.com` to verify that your SSL certificate is valid.
